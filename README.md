## INTRODUCTION
Stock market prediction and forecasting are crucial tasks in the field of finance. Predicting the future trends and prices of stocks can assist investors, traders, and financial institutions in making informed decisions. In this project, we aim to predict and forecast the stock prices of the company "Tata Global Beverages Limited" (TATAGLOBAL) using a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

There are multiple variables in the dataset â€“ date, open, high, low, last, close, total_trade_quantity, and turnover.

The columns Open and Close represent the starting and final price at which the stock is traded on a particular day.
High, Low and Last represent the maximum, minimum, and last price of the share for the day.
Total Trade Quantity is the number of shares bought or sold in the day and Turnover (Lacs) is the turnover of the particular company on a given date.

## RESULT
The results of the Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting project depend on the specific implementation and training of the Stacked LSTM model. By training the model on historical stock price data, we can obtain predictions and forecasts for future stock prices.

The performance of the model can be analyzed using evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). Lower values of these metrics indicate better predictive accuracy. Additionally, visualizations, such as line plots, can be used to compare the predicted and actual stock prices, providing a visual assessment of the model's performance.

## CONCLUSION
In the Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting project, we successfully utilized a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict and forecast stock prices for Tata Global Beverages Limited. By leveraging historical stock price data and employing a deep learning architecture, we aimed to assist investors and financial institutions in making informed decisions.

Through a series of steps, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation, we created a predictive model capable of capturing complex patterns and long-term dependencies in the sequential data. The Stacked LSTM model's ability to learn from historical data and make accurate predictions is particularly valuable in the context of stock market analysis.

To evaluate the model's performance, various evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were employed. These metrics allowed us to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. Additionally, visualizations were used to compare the predicted stock prices with the actual values, providing a comprehensive understanding of the model's effectiveness.

The Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting project offers practical insights into the field of financial forecasting. By applying deep learning techniques, specifically Stacked LSTM models, we were able to make predictions and forecasts that can aid investors, traders, and financial institutions in making well-informed decisions.

It's important to note that stock market prediction is a highly complex and volatile domain. While our model demonstrated promising results, further research and improvements can be pursued to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. Experimenting with different architectures, incorporating additional features, and fine-tuning hyperparameters are avenues for future exploration.

Overall, the Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting project showcases the potential of deep learning techniques, specifically Stacked LSTM models, in predicting and forecasting stock prices. The knowledge and experience gained from this project can contribute to the advancement of financial analysis and decision-making in the realm of stock market investments.
